Steps:
1) export the existing ENX data (earth coordinates data) to Matlab
- Velocity: E,N,Mag,Dir
- AncData: H,P,R
- Nav: all
- All bins

2) examine data quality
- compare speeds to high flow spring
- Check dir --CLEARLY WRONG AND SWITCHES WITH BOAT DIRECTION
- Check reasonable E vel
- check lat/long
3) Reprocess in VmDas as needed

Mat variables:
AnH: heading
AnP: pitch
AnR: roll
SerDay: day
SerDir: water direction
SerE: east velocity
SerEnsembles: 1:#ensembles??
SerHund: ??
SerMag: water speed
SerN: north velocity

Fix heading data:
- THE LOG BOOK IS WRONG
- adcp heading not recorded for some transects
- ADCP-AirMar offset for LtoR: +50
- ADCP-AirMar offset for RtoL: -50
Adjust VmDAS offsets to fix?
Keep EA=?
I exported from WinADCP using VMDAS as reference but the data still is off. Dir seems to be boat direction indicating that "water velocity" includes boat velocity.
Try processing ENS data in WinADCP with the different references?
